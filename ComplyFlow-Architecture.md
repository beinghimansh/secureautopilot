# ComplyFlow SaaS Platform Architecture

## Overview

ComplyFlow is a multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to help organizations manage their compliance requirements across various frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS). The platform streamlines compliance processes, automates tasks, and provides a comprehensive view of an organization's compliance posture.

## User Roles

The platform supports the following user roles:

1. **Super Admin**: Platform administrators who manage the entire system, onboard new organizations, and oversee platform operations.
2. **Company Admin**: Organization-level administrators who manage their organization's compliance program, users, and integrations.
3. **Compliance Officer**: Users responsible for implementing and managing compliance within an organization.
4. **Employee**: Regular users who perform assigned compliance tasks and contribute to the compliance program.
5. **Auditor**: External or internal auditors who review compliance evidence and conduct audits.

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

ComplyFlow uses a multi-tenant architecture with the following characteristics:

- Each organization is isolated through Row-Level Security (RLS) policies in the database
- Organizations can customize their compliance frameworks and workflows
- Data is logically separated between tenants while sharing the same infrastructure
- Role-based access control ensures appropriate data access within an organization

## Database Schema

The platform uses the following key tables:

- `organizations`: Stores organization information and subscription details
- `profiles`: User profiles with organization associations and roles
- `compliance_frameworks`: Tracks which frameworks an organization is implementing
- `policies`: Stores compliance policies and documentation
- `tasks`: Manages compliance-related tasks and assignments
- `integrations`: Tracks external service integrations
- `audits`: Manages audit processes and schedules
- `audit_findings`: Tracks findings from audits and their remediation status

## Customer Journey

### 1. Organization Onboarding

1. Super Admin creates a new organization in the platform
2. The organization is assigned a unique identifier and tenant space
3. Initial Company Admin user is created and linked to the organization

### 2. Company Setup

1. Company Admin logs in and completes organization profile
2. Selects applicable compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2, etc.)
3. Invites team members and assigns appropriate roles
4. Configures integrations with tools like AWS, GCP, Slack, or Jira

### 3. Compliance Framework Implementation

2. Tasks are completed and evidence is uploaded
3. Compliance Officers review task completion and evidence
4. Automated integration with tools (AWS, GCP, Slack, Jira) helps verify and document compliance

### 5. Monitoring and Reporting

1. Dashboard provides real-time compliance status across frameworks
2. Automated compliance checks run through integrations
3. Reports are generated for management review
4. Compliance gaps are identified and remediation tasks created

### 6. Audit Preparation and Execution

- **Jira**: Creates and tracks compliance-related tasks and projects

### DevOps & Security
- **GitHub/GitLab**: Monitors code repositories for security practices
- **CI/CD Tools**: Verifies security steps in deployment pipelines

## Technical Implementation

The platform is built using:

1. **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS for responsive UI
2. **Backend**: Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
3. **Security**: Row-Level Security policies for data isolation
4. **API**: RESTful API for integrations with external systems
5. **Automation**: Serverless functions for automated compliance checks

## Deployment Model

ComplyFlow is deployed as a cloud-based SaaS application with:

- Multi-region availability for data residency requirements
- Regular backups and disaster recovery
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- Compliance with relevant security standards

## Administrative Features

Super Admins can:

1. Create and manage organizations
2. Monitor platform usage and performance
3. Configure global settings and default frameworks
4. Access audit logs for platform activities
5. Generate system-wide reports and analytics

This architecture ensures ComplyFlow can scale to support organizations of all sizes while maintaining security, performance, and usability across different compliance needs.
