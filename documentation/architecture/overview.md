# Architecture Overview

## High-Level Architecture

ComplyFlow is built as a modern web application using a client-server architecture with several key components:

1. **Frontend Application**: A React-based single-page application (SPA) with responsive design using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
2. **Backend Services**: Powered by Supabase providing database, authentication, storage, and serverless functions
3. **AI Integration Layer**: Connects to OpenAI and Claude for policy generation and compliance assistance
4. **Voice Processing**: Integration with ElevenLabs for text-to-speech capabilities
5. **Security Layer**: Implements row-level security, authentication, and authorization controls

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Multi-tenant Design**: The platform is built with a multi-tenant architecture where each organization's data is logically isolated.
2. **Microservices Approach**: Core functionality is split into smaller, focused services including policy generation, voice summaries, and compliance management.
3. **Serverless Backend**: Leverages Supabase Edge Functions for server-side processing without managing infrastructure.
4. **API-First Design**: All features are exposed through well-defined APIs for extensibility.
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, with enhanced features when available.

## System Components

### Client Application

The client application is a React-based SPA with the following characteristics:

- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements
- State management using React's Context API and hooks
- Form handling with React Hook Form
- Client-side routing with React Router
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/ui component library for consistent UI elements

### Backend Services

Supabase provides the following backend services:

- PostgreSQL database for data storage
- Authentication and user management
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for data access control
- Edge Functions for serverless processing
- Storage buckets for file management
- Realtime subscriptions for live updates

### Integration Layer

The integration layer connects the platform with external services:

- OpenAI for policy generation and AI assistance
- ElevenLabs for text-to-speech conversion
- Webhook support for third-party integrations

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users authenticate through Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
2. **Data Access**: Client requests data from Supabase with RLS enforcing access controls
3. **Policy Generation**: User input is processed, sent to OpenAI via Edge Functions, and results stored in the database
4. **Voice Processing**: Text content is sent to ElevenLabs for conversion to audio, which is then stored and served to users

## Scaling Strategy

The platform is designed to scale horizontally:

- Stateless frontend can be deployed to multiple edge locations
- Supabase backend scales automatically based on demand
- Edge Functions provide serverless compute that scales to zero when not in use
- Database connection pooling manages concurrent connections efficiently

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented at multiple layers:

- Authentication using Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- Authorization through Row-Level Security policies
- Edge Functions for secure API key storage
- HTTPS encryption for all traffic
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning
